/**
 * In this challenge you need to print the data that accompanies each integer in
 * a list. In addition, if two strings have the same integers, you need to print
 * the strings in their original order. Hence, your sorting algorithm should be
 * stable, i.e. the original order should be maintained for equal elements.
 * 
 * Insertion Sort and the simple version of Quicksort were stable, but the
 * faster in-place version of Quicksort was not (since it scrambled around
 * elements while sorting).
 * 
 * In cases where you care about the original order, it is important to use a
 * stable sorting algorithm. In this challenge, you will use counting sort to
 * sort a list while keeping the order of the strings (with the accompanying
 * integer) preserved.
 * 
 * Challenge In the previous challenge, you created a "helper array" that
 * contains information about the starting position of each element in a sorted
 * array. Can you use this array to help you create a sorted array of the
 * original list?
 * 
 * Hint: You can go through the original array to access the strings. You can
 * then use your helper array to help determine where to place those strings in
 * the sorted array. Be careful about being one off.
 * 
 * Details and a Twist You will be given a list that contains both integers and
 * strings. Can you print the strings in order of their accompanying integers?
 * If the integers for two strings are equal, ensure that they are print in the
 * order they appeared in the original list.
 * 
 * The Twist - Your clients just called with an update. They don't want you to
 * print the first half of the original array. Instead, they want you to print a
 * dash for any element from the first half. So you can modify your counting
 * sort algorithm to sort the second half of the array only.
 * 
 * Input Format - nn, the size of the list arar. - nn lines follow, each
 * containing an integer xx and a string ss.
 * 
 * Output Format Print the strings in their correct order.
 * 
 * Constraints 1≤n≤1000000
 * 
 * n is even
 * 
 * 1≤ length(s) ≤10
 * 
 * 0≤x<100,x∈ar
 * 
 * The characters in every string in lowercase.
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 
 * 20
 * 
 * 0 ab
 * 
 * 6 cd
 * 
 * 0 ef
 * 
 * 6 gh
 * 
 * 4 ij
 * 
 * 0 ab
 * 
 * 6 cd
 * 
 * 0 ef
 * 
 * 6 gh
 * 
 * 0 ij
 * 
 * 4 that
 * 
 * 3 be
 * 
 * 0 to
 * 
 * 1 be
 * 
 * 5 question
 * 
 * 1 or
 * 
 * 2 not
 * 
 * 4 is

 * 2 to

 * 4 the
 * 
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * 
 * - - - - - to be or not to be - that is the question - - - -
 * 
 * Explanation
 * 
 * Below is the list in the correct order. The strings of each number were
 * printed above for the second half of the array. Elements from the first half
 * of the original array were replaced with dashes.
